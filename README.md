# DESeq2 Analysis
## Overview

This document describes the analysis of RNA-seq data using DESeq2, a popular tool for differential gene expression analysis. The analysis includes steps for data import, differential expression analysis, and result visualization.

**Data Import and Preparation and Database Construction**

Create or load a txdb database for importing .sf files using tximport. Define functions to import gene counts and create metadata tables

**Differential Expression Analysis done with DESeq2 Analysis** 

Create DESeq2 dataset and run differential expression analysis and Generates volcano plots and filter results.

Genes of interest for GBM are then further investigated.
